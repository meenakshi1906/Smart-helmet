A regular helmet is converted into a Smart helmet that has the following 2 features: 

1. Navigation system: Navigation assistance (Directions and distance to the destination) is displayed on the top corner of the visor of the helmet. 
2. Communication system: A transmitter receiver circuit that uses FM radio transmission for communication between 2 people wearing the smart helmets.

*Our Android app has been tested for working only on the Google Pixel 3a.
